# Self-Generative-City
 Self-Generative Urban Model Based on Cellular Automata

Assignment2 for Course _#6339 Introduction to Computational Design_


Cellular Automata is a discrete model computation. It reveals that when many simple agents work together, they can exhibit a complex intelligent behavior. City elements, such as buildings, green space coexist to form a city. Based on the theory of cellular automation, this project creates a self-constructed urban system. 

In this system, if a single parcel is sur-rounded by too many or too few parcels of a certain type, the type of the parcel will change. Therefore it generates a variety of different simulations based on height, slope, contours, shadows, drainage and aspect of the landscape model.

By setting different rules, this project creates 3 types of urban development models. In the capital driv-en model, residential and commercial parcels are hardly ever restricted, so they grow to their density limits. In the policy driven model, residential, commercial and green parcels interact with each other to create a dynamic balance. In the ecology driven model, green space becomes a major consideration.
